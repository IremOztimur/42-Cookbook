# 42 Projects Repository

A comprehensive collection of projects completed as part of the 42 curriculum. This repository showcases diverse programming skills developed through hands-on, peer-to-peer learning. Each project reflects the journey of mastering fundamental and advanced concepts in software development, from system programming to web development and artificial intelligence.

## About the 42 Curriculum

The 42 program offers a project-based approach to coding education, focusing on practical and industry-relevant skills. The curriculum is divided into two phases:

- **Common Core**: Core programming fundamentals necessary for entry-level professional roles.
- **Advanced**: Specializations in various topics like algorithms, networks, and object-oriented programming.

## Repository Highlights
This repository documents projects from the Common Core and Advanced phases of the curriculum.
